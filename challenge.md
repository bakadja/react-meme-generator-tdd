# Challenge-1:
************

Task: Add a component test for the Main component. 

Description: Check that the Main component shows the actual text lines "One does not simply" and "Walk into Mordor" in the document. It should also check that the img with the src "https://i.imgflip.com/1bij.jpg" is in the document.

Steps:
1. Create a new file `Main.test.jsx` next to `Main.jsx`.
2. Import necessary functions from 'vitest' and '@testing-library/react'.
3. Import the component.
4. Add a test for the meme text lines and image. 
  1. Render the component.
  2. Add 3 assertions using `expect`. For the `img`, expect `src` `toBe` "https://i.imgflip.com/1bij.jpg". 
  3. See the tests in `Header.test.jsx` for reference.
5. See Vitest test runner picking the new test, running it, and passing, all green.


# challenge -2

Task: Add another component test for the Main component to cover the rest of the UI of the app. 

Description: Check that the Main component shows the labels "Top Text" and "Bottom Text". In addition, it should show two text input fields with the placeholder texts "One does not simply" and "Walk into Mordor" in the document. Finally, check that it shows a button with the text "Get a new meme image ðŸ–¼". Organize all tests in the file in a test suite.

Steps:
1. Add a new test in the file `Main.test.jsx`.
2. Pick a good name that sums up what the test is asserting.
3. Render the component.
4. Add 5 assertions using `expect`. Use the queries `getByText` for querying the labels, `getByPlaceholderText` for querying the text input fields, and `getByRole` for querying the button.
5. What's the accessible role of the button in the DOM? It's `button`. See the list of all available roles here: 
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Guides/Techniques#roles
6. See Vitest test runner picking up the new test, running it, and passing, all green.
7. Use `describe` to organize all tests in this file in a test suite. What should the name of the test suite be?


# Challenge-3:
************

Task: Add a test for updating the bottom text. Use the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern.

Description: Check that after the user clears the second textbox and types "Code without coffee" in it, the App component will display the new bottom text in the document.

Steps:
1. Add a new test in the file `App.test.jsx`.
2. Pick a good name that sums up what the test is asserting.
3. Apply the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern.
4. Create a user using `userEvent.setup()`.
5. Render the component.
6. Query the second textbox, using `getAllByRole`, and the role `textbox`.
7. `await` the user `clear`ing the textbox. Make the function `async`.
8. `await` the user `type`ing the text `Code without coffee`.
9. Assert, using `expect` that the text is displayed in the document.
10. See Vitest test runner picking up the new test, running it, and passing, all green.
11. Use `describe` to organize all tests in this file in a test suite. What should the name of the test suite be?




# Challenge-4:
************

Task: Add a test for getting a new meme image.

Description: The test should check that after the user click the "Get a new meme image ðŸ–¼" button, a new image is displayed. Use the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern. Only finish the first two parts of the pattern.

Optional for Extra Credit: Add the Assert part as well. What is the `src` of the meme image that the mock service will return?

Steps:
1. Add a new test in the file `App.test.jsx`.
2. Pick a good name that sums up what the test is asserting.
3. Add the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern skeleton.
4. Create a user using `userEvent.setup()`.
5. Render the component.
6. Query the button, using `getByRole`, and the role `button`.
7. In the Act part, have the user `click` on the button. What does that return? Does the test function need to be `async`? 
8. See Vitest test runner picking up the new test, running it, and passing, all green.
